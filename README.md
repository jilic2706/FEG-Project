# FEG-Project
## Running & Testing
To run the project, you would either have to install the Live Server extension on Visual Studio Code or download the npm package of the same name. I - personally - used the latter by positioning myself in the project directory and executing `live-server` in the terminal.

## Known Issues
* The search filters do not work. Reason is: they are not implemented as of yet.
* The 'Load More' button behaves a little strangely on certain conditions.
  * One such _condition_ is searcing an item by name before expanding the list.
